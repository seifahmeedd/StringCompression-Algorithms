# String Compression with RLE 🧵📦

A comparative C++ implementation of string compression using **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** via two algorithmic approaches: **Brute Force** and **Dynamic Programming**. Developed as part of an academic research project at Misr International University.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores how different algorithmic strategies affect the efficiency and scalability of string compression. It includes:

- **Brute Force Algorithm**: Exhaustively evaluates all single-split combinations.
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**: Optimizes compression by caching subproblem results.
- **RLE Logic**: Compresses repeated characters into a compact form (e.g., `"aaaabb"` → `"a4b2"`).
- **Case Handling**: Returns original string if compression is ineffective or equal in size.
